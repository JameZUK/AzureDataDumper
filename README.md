# AzureDataDumper
A bunch of useful PowerDhell scripts to dump details from Azure. Useful for report or design documentation after the fact.

To use these scripts, first you need to be logged in via Connect-AzAccount. All the scripts work in the same way and will iterate through every subscription they hacve access to and output the data into a GridView and a CSV file.

The code isn't great but it work for my purposes.
